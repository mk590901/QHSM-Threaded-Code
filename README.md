# QHSM Threaded Code Sample

The presented application is identical in appearance to the application https://github.com/mk590901/QQHsm-Switch-Dart, although it lacks the HSM runtime framework. It's replaced by the Sw1Helper class (file sw1_helper.dart).

## Key elements of the application.
* __Sw1Helper__ class in the _scheme/sw1_helper.dart_ file. This is a file automatically generated by the HSM editor __scheduler__. The file is slightly modified manually in order to connect the state machine logic with the __GUI elements__ of the application. Pay attention to the commented lines. Note that _empty transfer functions isn't using_.
* __QHsmHelper__ class. Responsible for creating and running threaded code chains. Pay attention to the __run__ function.
* __ThreadedCodeExecutor__ class implements threaded code execution.
* The relationship of the classes is shown below in the UML diagram:
